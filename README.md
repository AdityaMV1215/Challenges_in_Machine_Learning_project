# Challenges in Machine Learning

* Welcome to the Extreme Challenges in Machine Learning!

* In this project, you will demonstrate what you have learned in this course by conducting an experiment dealing with Credits dataset.

* We have seen in the lectures what are the challenges needs to face in case of the data is imbalanced.

## What we have learned so far:


## What we are going to do?
* So in this exercise You are given a data set. Use your Machine learning skills to solve it. 
* Yes! you are correct use whatever you feel like to solve these exercise and get the best AUC score. 


## What your will learn by doing this assignment ?
* These exercise will be good kick start for your future Hackerthon competition.
* You will be learning how to handle dataset from start to end.

### Dataset
To perform these excerise we will use `Credits` dataset from ISLR library.

This dataset contains following features:
- Income
- Limit
- Rating
- Cards
- Age
- Education
- Gender
- Married
- Ethnicity
- Balance

**Target Variable:**
- Student
